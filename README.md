# KokyÅ«
The [20s GameJam Kokyu](https://littleb0xes.itch.io/kokyu) made with Go and Ebitengine.

Out of curiosity, I also tried to do the same thing but with Rust and macroquad [here](https://github.com/LittleB0xes/kokyu_rs)

## Story

It's the end of your life. Your last breath. The last hope to destroy the spirits that haunt our world. Be fast, be in sync... in one breath

## Commands

* Left:	Left Arrow
* Right:	Right Arrow
* Jump:	Space 
* Attack 1:	C
* Attack 2:	V
* Dash:	Direction + V

You can try to make some combos, but you will need to be accurate...


## Credits

The main character  came from [Hugues Laborde](https://hugues-laborde.itch.io) with some addition / modification from me. The rest of the graphical assets was made by me with Aseprite. The (great) color  palette is slso8  created by [solosalsero](https://lospec.com/solosalsero) from Lospec.

All sound effect and "music" was made in my kitchen with Renoise and Audacity

# Disclaimer

This very small unfinished game is my contribution for the 20s Game Jam and it's still a WIP. It's more of a draft of an idea that I would like to turn into a more complete game (if I had the time  :-D) But *tada*, it's the first time I make my own sound. I also had the opportunity to experiment a lot of new things on the code side. In short, not finished certainly, but very instructive for me.
